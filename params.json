{"name":"UNIJS","tagline":"A web-based windowed console environment","body":"# UNIJS\r\n(JS must be pronounced similarly to X for maximum pun effect)\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"demo/index.html\">Try it!</a></h2>\r\n\r\n### UNIJS is a web-based windowed console environment.\r\nWhat does that mean? UNIJS is what a non-technical user would probably call an operating system. Thankfully, it is not! It is a web app that recreates a windowed desktop environment inside a browser window (or even better, a HTML5 app), and allows console programs to be executed. It provides an API and  a way to install new programs, and the programs can be combined using pipes as in UNIX.\r\n\r\n### What is this useful for?\r\nThis is useful for creating extensible but controlled sandboxed environments that can run on any computer, for example for programming contests.\r\n\r\n### Are we there yet?\r\nNope, sorry. The journey has just started and this is what is done:\r\n\r\n  - Basic windows environment\r\n    - Window creation, deletion, resizing, movement, snip, keyboard shortcuts\r\n    - Customization using environment variables (terminal colors, window color, wallpaper)\r\n  - Program loader (not from the \"inner\" filesystem yet)\r\n  - Stream implementation: pipes and redirects\r\n  - Some basic programs (cat, echo, ls, tree, mkdir, wget, caesar...)\r\n  - File System API\r\n    - Locks ( slock on read, xlock on write, unlock on close)\r\n  -Basic manual (man command)\r\n  \r\nAnd this is still missing:\r\n  - Interchangeable OS modules (file system, sensors data, notifications, whatever...)\r\n  - Everything else\r\n  \r\nOf course, you are welcome to report issues and submit pull requests!\r\n\r\nThe terminal is implemented using the [JQuery Terminal Emulator](https://github.com/jcubic/jquery.terminal)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
